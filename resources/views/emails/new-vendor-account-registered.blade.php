Hi there and congratulations! You are now an official shop owner in The People’s Pantry. As a supplier within the Pantry,

We dont want our shelves to be empty, after all. Our planned launch is XX/XX/XXXX, 
so tell your family and friends who love your (insert the thing you make here) is about to be on sale at the People’s Pantry.
Thanks so much,
