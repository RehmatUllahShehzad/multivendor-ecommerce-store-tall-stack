                            <p>We’re a group of friends with a desire to connect with people. This idea came to light
                                because we felt people should know who they get their food from. We want farmers,
                                artisans, and producers to be a part of our lives. That is where People’s Pantry came
                                from. The power of local is here to stay and we want to be a part of your journey.</p>
